I record moments and share them on my youtube channel here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCH2DwKPa2q_8o_xvdLhRpVw?view_as=subscriber\nPeace!","email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Rizwan Qamar","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":null,"rating":null,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":120,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d87454","address":"Jail Rd Opposit Dring Stadium, Bahawalpur Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Bahawalpur Zoo","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#175 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":3.5,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":121,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d874c2","address":"Jhelum Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Lehri National Park","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":null,"rating":null,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":122,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d873ea","address":"Shahi Mohallah St, Lahore Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":31.58771,"longitude":74.31198,"name":"Roshnai Gate","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#136 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":123,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d87332","address":"Fort Road, Lahore 54000 Pakistan","description":null,"email":"info@walledcitylahore.gop.pk","latitude":31.589573,"longitude":74.31305,"name":"Lahore Fort","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#4 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.5,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":"http:\/\/walledcitylahore.gop.pk\/tourist-sites\/#"},{"attraction_id":124,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d873d7","address":"Patriata Road Highest Point Of Murree Hills, New Murree Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":33.875168,"longitude":73.4562,"name":"Patriata Chair Lift","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#32 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":"http:\/\/www.tdcp.gop.pk\/page.php?pid=221"},{"attraction_id":125,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d8738a","address":"Walton Road, Lahore Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":31.470356,"longitude":74.35445,"name":"Packages Mall","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#28 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.5,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":"http:\/\/packagesmall.com\/"},{"attraction_id":126,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d8733d","address":"Multan 44000 Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Multan Garrison Mess","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#104 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":127,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d8732f","address":"Baba Safra Road, Multan Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Tomb Shah Shams Sabzwari Tabrez","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#65 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":128,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d87429","address":"Lahore Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Sacred Heart Cathedral","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#197 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":129,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d87476","address":"At the back of Haveli Kabli Mal, Lahore 54000 Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":null,"longitude":null,"name":"Shrine of Syed Shams Shahzada","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#223 of 333 things to do in Punjab Province","rating":4.0,"reviews":"[]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":130,"_id":"619e5dfdc2dcfc7041d874ad","address":"Lahore Pakistan","description":"I am Masroor, native from beautiful city of Lahore, Pakistan.

Hassan was the driver & efficiently handled some of the most dangerous & difficult roads & both of them assisted in photography too. At all times I was made to feel safe.

After travel plans were delayed in 2020, I made it a top priority to come to Pakistan in 2021. \\n\\nThrough social media, I found the company Cross Roads Adventure and met Sultan, the owner and he became my tour guide combo driver for my solo trip in Hunza Pakistan. Sultan was very friendly, kind, understanding, honest and made sure that all his guests have the best experience possible in Pakistan.\\n\\n After almost 6 months of logistics planning for the trip, organizing visa, flight, hotel, other documents, I finally met Sultan in Hunza to start my tour.  The visa process for Pakistan is quite complicated and you will need many documents which are all provided by Sultan - to submit to the Pakistani embassy in your country. This process may take a few weeks so don\u2019t delay.\\n\\nI had a 7 day tour which included highlights of treks to various viewpoints with beautiful scenery, trying local Hunza cuisine, meeting Sultan\u2019s family (his baby is very cute!) and meeting and enjoying a delicious biryani meal with his family,, visiting the Attabad Lake area, driving on Karakoram Highway, visiting historical forts in Hunza, day trip to the Khunjerab pass\/Pak-China border with Sultan\u2019s brother, multiple suspension bridges, glaciers, walnut cake  and many laughs, insightful conversations, and friendships made along the journey.  \\n\\nDuring my tour, I stayed at Hunza Darbar Hotel, Gilgit Serena, and Luxus Hunza. Luxus was my favorite and I give a strong recommendation! For food, we tried many local restaurants throughout Hunza - some area specialties include chap surf - a meat sandwich for the Gilgit Baltistan region and Hunza samosas by the glacier.\\n\\n Sultan was a great guide , driver, planner ,and organizer who helped organize daily activities, book flight and drivers , reserve my hotels, change the plans for me if necessary. Sultan also drove me most of the week and helped me learn how to trek for the first time in Pakistan. \\n\\nThe Hunza area has tremendous potential for tourism market growth in the near future. I strongly believe that in the years to come, there is a very bright future for Sultan and his company Crossroads Adventure as the world continues to open post-pandemic. I wish Sultan, his family, his company, and the whole people of GB\/Hunza\/Pakistan a successful outlook as the whole country continue to welcome more and more foreign tourists with each and every passing-year. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to Hunza in the future and I can\u2019t wait to see all of the new changes, growth and development. I enthusiastically recommend Sultan and Cross Roads Adventure\\n\\nOverall Rating: 10\/10 \\nFrom:\\nAndy N\\nNew York, NY, USA\",\"publishedDate\":\"2021-07-16T03:31:27-04:00\",\"rating\":\"5\",\"travelDate\":\"2021-07\",\"user\":{\"username\":\"tpeb2021\"},\"subratings\":[],\"machineTranslated\":false}]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsadventure.earth\/"},{"attraction_id":190,"_id":"6194e5d536579145e9e927b4","address":"Karimabad Pakistan","description":"This palace\/fortress is over seven centuries old.","email":"info@baltitfort.org","latitude":36.325584,"longitude":74.6698,"name":"Baltit Fort","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#5 of 64 things to do in Gilgit-Baltistan","rating":4.5,"reviews":"[{\"language\":\"en\",\"title\":\"Fine example of historic architecture\",\"text\":\"Well maintained and the guides are knowledge and friendly.

The transition of landscape from dry, barren, rugged mountains to lush green mountains clad with juniper trees is dramatic. In fact, this area has the second largest juniper tree jungle in the world. On the way to Ziarat you can see, and visit, apple orchards and strawberry plantation which is an additional \\\"perk\\\" of the visit. Road to Ziarat is not in a good shape but one can travel easily in a motor car. Main attraction here is Quaid-e-Azam residency. Few minutes drive from Residency is \\\"zero point\\\" from where you can see breathtaking views of juniper forest from top of the mountain. Due to snow in December and January you should check whether the area id open or not. Also, nearby, just before Bab-e-Ziarat, is a small waterfall, which has been turned into a water pond for supply to nearby areas.\\n\\nOverall, its a nice day out with exciting mountain scenery and fresh air.\",\"publishedDate\":\"2021-03-28T06:20:11-04:00\",\"rating\":\"4\",\"travelDate\":\"2021-03\",\"user\":{\"username\":\"AJ-0017\"},\"subratings\":[],\"machineTranslated\":false}]","type":"ATTRACTION","website":null},{"attraction_id":218,"_id":"619e708cc2dcfc7041d878fd","address":"Gaddani Bazar, Bela 90300 Pakistan","description":null,"email":null,"latitude":25.086107,"longitude":66.73078,"name":"Gadani Beach","photos":null,"provider":null,"ranking":"#15 of 18 things to do in Balochistan Province","rating":3.0,"reviews":"[{\"language\":\"en\",\"title\":\"Gaddani Beach Or Gadani\",\"text\":\"Gadani Ship Breaking Yard.
